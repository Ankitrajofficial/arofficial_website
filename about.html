        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome! We believe that everyone deserves to wake up with a sense of clarity and purpose. Our mission is to provide simple, practical tools to help you build a more intentional and fulfilling life.</p>
        <p>This book was written by Ankit Raj, a student and life coach who, just like you, understands the feeling of being stuck or unmotivated. He wrote this book not as a guru, but as a guide who's on the same journey, sharing the practical systems that led him to find his own clarity.</p>
        <p>We're not just selling a book; we're building a community of people who are ready to stop waiting and start living.</p>
